The first feature which I believe can ba a good one connected with my game I am planning to create is that my rock, papaer, scissors game initally has its score which the user can set by putting a number greater than zero. Accordingly the programme will decide how many times the user and the computer must play and reach to the point written by the user to end the game. If the user prints a number less than 1 the programm asks to insert a valid number again and again untill the user prints a number greater than 0. After the game will ask the user to choose a number for a special type of choice. For example 1 will be rock, 2 will be papaer and so on. 
Another feature which my programm can have is connected with the computer`s choice. Of course the computer chooses randomly and the results can be in three occasional ways. One option is that both the computer and the user choose the same thing, for example rock. Then the programm understands that it is draw and prints the score without adding anythhing. The next case is that you beat the computer and after interpreting it the programm prints the score adding 1 point to your score. And the last case is the same as in the second case but vice versa.
